# Dotfiles

Based off of Paul Irish's dotfiles, these are tweaked for my own personal use. It might be useful for others when setting up a new Mac as well.

You can check his out [here](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone/download this repo locally (anywhere)
1. Copy-paste parts of `setup-a-new-machine.sh`, or run the whole thing in Terminal (includes `.osx` and `symlink-setup.sh`)

### Manually run

* `setup-a-new-machine.sh` - XCode, Homebrew, other useful things
* `symlink-setup.sh` - Sets up symlinks for all dotfiles and vim config
* `.osx` - Run on a fresh OS X setup
* `brew.sh` & `brew-cask.sh` - Homebrew initialization
